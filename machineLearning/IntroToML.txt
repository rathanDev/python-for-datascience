ML = Statistical Learning

3 main types of ML algorithms

Supervised 
Unsupervised
Reinforcement

1. Supervised
We have labeled data, we try to predict a label based off of known features

2. Unsupervised
We have unlabeled data, we try to group together similar data points based off of features

self-organizing maps
nearest neighbour mapping 
k-means clustering

3. Reinforcement
Algorithm learn to perform an action from experience

Often used for robotics, gaming and navigation
